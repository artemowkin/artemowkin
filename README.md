### Хэлоу, I'm Artyom 👋

I'm a Python backend developer from Russia who loves FastAPI, Django, Starlette, PyDantic and many other libraries and frameworks. Also sometimes write something on Vue.js with TypeScript.

I enjoy watching chinese cartoons (anime), drinkink Drive energy drink and eating russians "слоечки😍" from "Ярче☀" store. Oh, and coding something during this.
